## Organisation
* Prediction_task.ipynb : notebook contained all process to build classification models and so on.
* Graph_analysis.ipynb : notebook where we analysed the graph where the file and the sim_matrix. 
* data : where the dataset is stored in the project.
* Figures : where the figures(histograms....) is stored
* models : where the persistance of the models built is stored.
* pdf : we also provided the pdf version of the different notebook.
* results_test : where the test file is stored. We already fill theses files.
